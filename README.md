In This Project:
- I used AngularJS to integrate with back-end APIs via controllers
- I tried to apply MVC structure along with using services for BL
- I made environment js file for flexible base URL
- I used angular-ui-bootstrap for auto completeion and made custom validation
- I made user inputs values to be saved in local stoarge to prevent data loss when refershing page (will be discarded if saved to db)
- calculations on total debit and credit values are done
- enforced validation on required fields and credit/debit values to ensure only one value is entered and the other is 0 , also total of credit is equal to total of debit
- bootstrap modal for delete conformation when row of entry detail has data
- data is saved in backend and it goes through validation and exception handling too!
